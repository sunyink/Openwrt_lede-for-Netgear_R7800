Description:   The Berkeley Open Infrastructure for Network Computing (BOINC) is a
  software platform for distributed computing: several initiatives of
  various scientific disciplines all compete for the idle time of
  desktop computers. The developers' web site at the University of
  Berkeley serves as a common portal to the otherwise independently run
  projects.

  This package provides the BOINC wrapper that runs the Project applications as
  subprocesses, and handles all communication with the BOINC client
  (e.g., to report CPU time and fraction done).
